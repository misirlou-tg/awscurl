Building this project and vcpkg dependencies via CMake

=== Building locally (tested on Ubuntu 24.04)

Assumptions:
- Compiler, CMake are installed
- vcpkg is cloned in the root of the repo at vcpkg
- vcpkg has been bootstrapped

Configure build (and make vcpkg dependencies):
cmake -B build -S .

Build project:
cmake --build build

=== GitHub workflow

The GitHub workflow uses actions I found here:
https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-vcpkg

The build steps use 'presets' that can be found in `CMakePresets.json`
